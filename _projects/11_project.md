Supporting sound and complete query answering over knowledge graphs under very complex classes of rules has been a long-standing problem in AI. This is the first technique to support query answering under second-order rules with equality in the order of milliseconds. The technique has been implemented on top of the <a href="https://www.oxfordsemantic.tech/rdfox">RDFOX's</a> Java API and has been developed in collaboration with Oxford Semantics Technologies.
