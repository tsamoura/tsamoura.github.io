From 2019 to 2025, I was a Senior Researcher at Samsung AI, Cambridge, UK, leading the research on reasoning and neurosymbolic learning. In 2016, I was awarded a prestigious early career fellowship from the Alan Turing Institute, UK, and before that, I a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Computer Science of the University of Oxford. My recent outcomes involve scaling symbolic reasoning to billions of triples, as well as addressing open problems in neurosymbolic learning.</p> <p>I am joining the Huawei Labs as a Technical Expert in May 2025.</p> </body></html>
