I am a researcher working on logic, knowledge representation and reasoning, and neurosymbolic learning.
From 2019 to 2025, I was a Senior Researcher at Samsung AI, Cambridge, UK, leading research on reasoning and neurosymbolic learning. 
In 2016, I was awarded a prestigious early career fellowship from the Alan Turing Institute, UK, for my work on logic and databases, and before that, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Computer Science of the University of Oxford. 


One of the best moments in my career was my participation in the <a href="https://research.samsung.com/2021saif">Samsung AI Forum</a> in 2021, where I joined the panel on neurosymbolic AI with professors <a href='#'>Leslie Valiant</a> and <a href='#'>Daniel Dongyuel Lee</a>. A second highlight was an invitation I received from the Royal Society, London, in 2024 to participate in the <a href="https://rsc-src.ca/en/events/frontiers-science-2024">Frontiers of Science (FoS) meeting</a> and discuss the challenges of deep learning with leaders in the field, including professors <a href='#'>Yoshua Bengio</a> and <a href='#'>Doina Precup</a>.

My recent outcomes involve scaling symbolic reasoning and query answering to billions of triples, as well as addressing open problems in neurosymbolic learning, see 
<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/hash/1e83498c3eafe109a44b12979c2c73db-Abstract-Conference.html">NeurIPS 2023</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10000">arXiv 2024</a>. I was also the first to develop 
<a href="https://tsamoura.github.io/projects/11_project.html">goal-driven query answering techniques under second-order theories</a> that run in the order of milliseconds, correcting an incompleteness error of previous work. See <a href="https://tsamoura.github.io/projects/">my software page</a> for further information.

I am joining Huawei Labs as a Technical Expert in May 2025.
