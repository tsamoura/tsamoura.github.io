UK","summary":"I was leading research on reasoning and neurosymbolic learning within SAIC-Cambridge.","highlights":["I developed provably correct techniques that scaled logical reasoning to billions of facts and led to deep models with substantially higher accuracy.","I was the first to prove that we can learn neural classifiers using logical theories as the source of supervision, characterizing also learning imbalances in neurosymbolic learning.","I developed CPU-based techniques capable of scaling rule mining to millions of facts, taking less than 1% of the run time needed by the state-of-the-art GPU-based approaches.","I was the first to show how to efficiently answer queries in second-order logical theories that include millions of facts, while preserving the correctness and completeness of the answers."]},{"name":"Turing Institute, UK","position":"Research Fellow","startDate":"2016-10-01","endDate":"2018-12-31","location":"London, UK","summary":"My research focused on
