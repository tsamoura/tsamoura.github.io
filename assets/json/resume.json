      "highlights": ["I developed provably correct techniques that scaled logical reasoning and query answering to billions of facts and led to deep models with substantially higher accuracy over the state-of-the-art.","I was the first to prove that we can learn neural classifiers using logical theories as the source of supervision. I was also the first to characterize learning imbalances in neurosymbolic learning.", "I developed CPU-based techniques capable of (i) scaling rule mining to millions of facts and (ii) learning more accurate logical theories in less than 1% of the run time needed by the state-of-the-art GPU-based approaches.", "I was the first to show how to efficiently answer queries in second-order logical theories that include millions of facts, while preserving the correctness and completeness of the answers.", "I led the organization of two Samsung workshops on neurosymbolic learning and co-organized five workshops and panels on neurosymbolic learning in KR, AAMAS, KDD, and ISWC." ]
